Special Cases which are currently not handled:

data_upload.file_handling split_sequence_line():
  only forward alignments are processed (->MAF file '+'), reverse-complement sequences (->MAF file '-') are ignored


data_upload.file_handling sequence_length_mismatch():
  two sequences are aligned but at least one of them is having a gap, deletion, etc. so it's not an exact match


data_upload.file_handling alignment_handling():
  '-' is not included in the alignment length in the MAF file; if '-' exists in the sequence we have a wrong alignment length


data_upload.file_handling assembly_handling():
  'N' exists in the assembly file: how should it be processed

data_upload.import_interation
  '-' is included in finding the longest common substring
